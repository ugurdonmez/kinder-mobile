## Installation Reminder:
After 'npm install', delete  firebase.d.ts in /node_modules/firebase folder. Because it is a duplicate of 'app.d.ts' in that folder, which causes 'Duplicate Identifiers' error.  
## Use ionic:
run script to run on browsers because ionic:serve is incompatible with Cordova's Camera plugin.
